-   Added binary script to return path to auxilliary support files used in ant scripts and other places that are
    contained in this gem.

-   Added call-rake.xml ant script for use in spawning calls to rake from intellij managed, and general,

0.9.11.beta

-   Buyers remorse on createArgs it now uses only one named argument :$@
    This makes life a lot simpler and more future proof in case later versions of rake use
    additional named aruments

    examples:

    task :withCreateArgs, :$@=>{ :arg0=>'val0', :arg1=>val1 ...}  do   end
    task :withCreateArgs=>[ :deps ], :$@=>{ :arg0=>'val0', :arg1=>val1 ...}  do   end
    task :withCreateArgs,  [ :commandLineArg, ... ], :$@=>{ :arg0=>'val0', :arg1=>val1 ...}  do   end
    task :withCreateArgs,  [ :commandLineArg, ... ]=>[ :deps ], :$@=>{ :arg0=>'val0', :arg1=>val1 ...}  do   end

0.9.10.beta

-   definiteitely some bugfixes in the heat of getting projects to build.

-   Some cleanup on the CppProjects module

-   Added RaspberiPiCppTools for building C,C++ code on the Raspberi Pi.

-   Added rakish Rakish::SearchPath to facilitate finding executables in the current PATH or items in the classpath
    or other paths.

-   Added BuildConfig#findInPath to Rakish::ProjectConfig

-   Added experimental "createArgs" to Rake::Task to allow setting named values in a Task at "define_task" time.
    Since the added args can not be the same as the task name, using a prefix on the keys of '@' or '$' is a good way
    of preventing conflicts as these are not typically used as task names. This feature requires ruby 1.9.x+ to work.

    examples:

    task :withCreateArgs, :arg0=>'val0', :arg1=>val1 ... do   end
    task :withCreateArgs=>[ :deps ], :arg0=>'val0', :arg1=>val1 ... do   end
    task :withCreateArgs,  [ :commandLineArg, ... ], :arg0=>'val0', :arg1=>val1 ... do   end
    task :withCreateArgs,  [ :commandLineArg, ... ]=>[ :deps ], :arg0=>'val0', :arg1=>val1 ... do   end

    removed the "Task#data" method as the "Task#createArgs" now substitutes and this was only used in one place in the
    windows C compiler tools manifest builder task.

-   Added Rakish::FileSetTask to check timestamps on a collection of files specified with wildcards but not have them
    added as prerequisites.  The wildcards are evaluated the first time the timestamp is checked which is when a task with
    a dependency on it checks it's dependencies.  The wildcards are specified at instantiation time.

    This to handle executing a task if any of the files found have been touched.

-   Added fileset_task convenience method ro Rakish::Utils
