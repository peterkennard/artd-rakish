==Binary Utilities and Support files.

===artd-rakish-find

This is a utilty to find a non-ruby support file packaged with this gem.  It was needed
to handle finding files when managed by the rvm package manger and other systems.

It will return the full path via stdout to the location of the support files if found in the gem.

On windows in my installation it will return via stdout only if piped so it doesn't spawn a
command shell window - an annoyance with windows !!

ie:

    $ artd-rakish-find call-rake.xml > foo
    $ type foo
    D:/artd/third-party/tools/Ruby193/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/rakish-0.9.12.beta/bin/artd-rakish-bin/call-rake.xml

===call-rake.xml

This is an ant script the XML file used as follows on linux or windows to facilitate calling rake tasks from ant scripts:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <project name="rake-targets" default="">
        <exec executable="artd-rakish-find" outputproperty="rake.ant.xml">
            <arg value="call-rake.xml"/>
        </exec>
        <import file="${rake.ant.xml}" />

        <target name="subdirTest" description="test required subprojects">
            <call-rake file="./test/subdir-test/rakefile.rb" target="subdir-test:test"/>
        </target>
    </project>
