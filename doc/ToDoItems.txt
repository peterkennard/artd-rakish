==Items To Do

===Of course make a decent C++/C/asm module for msc and gcc g++ etc
The ones in here now work but are not very elegant.  They sort of happen
when a project needs them.

===Make a usable MultiProcessTask for spawning multiple asynchronous tasks
The one in Rake actually slows things down when too
many are spawned due to the thread switching overhead so it really isn't practical.  What it should do is maintain a semaphore
managed queue and only spawn as many tasks as there are processor cores on the machine to handle the big processes they
spawn ( compilers and the like ) the little ruby tasks are better off being run in the primary thread unless they are
doing something with a lot of waiting involved like uploading a file. In any case limiting the number of ruby threads
would help this too.

===Design and build a better configuration registration system.
One that can deal with inheritance and overriding in
sub projects for now there is on one global configuration for an entire module tree

===Set up WindowsCPP module to get it's paths and windows sdks from standard installs.
Using the "VCVars32.bat" files or environment
variables from installs.  For now it uses compilers I have pre-configured in a "third-party" folder
and the paths to their tools are hard coded.

===Make tomcat servlet module releasable
===A real manual
===Make intellij integration module releasable (partly done)
