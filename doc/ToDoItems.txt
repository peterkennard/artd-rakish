==Items To Do

===Of course make a decent C++/C/asm module for msc and gcc g++ etc

===Make a usable MultiProcessTask for spawning multiple asynchronous tasks
The one in Rake actually slows things down when too
many are spawned due to the thread swithing overhead so it really isn't practical.  What it should do is maintain a semaphone
managed queue and only spawn as many tasks as there are processor cores on the machine to handle the big processes they
spawn ( compilers and the like ) the little ruby tasks are better off being run in the primary thread unless they are
doing something with a lot of waiting involved like uploading a file. In any case limiting the number of threads
would help this too.

===Make tomcat servlet module releasable
===A real manual
