# A set of Ruby Rake build scripts I use for building the other repositories

## This requires thet ruby and rake are installed and available in the path.
## out of the box with Mac OS
## Has to be installed on windows.  Though this can be installed as a Gem I prefer to put it in each major project as an effective fork similar to the way gradle is used in java projects.
